# Course Grade Average Calculator

## Overview
The Course Grade Average Calculator is a simple web application that allows users to input their course marks and calculates the average grade. Based on the average, it assigns a letter grade according to predefined criteria. This application is built using HTML and JavaScript.

## Features
- Prompts the user to enter the number of courses they have completed.
- Validates the input to ensure it is a positive integer.
- Collects course marks for each course and validates that each mark is a number between 0 and 100.
- Calculates the average of the entered marks.
- Assigns a letter grade based on the average.
- Displays the course marks, average, and corresponding letter grade to the user.

## How to Use
1. Open the HTML file in a web browser.
2. When prompted, enter the number of courses you have completed.
3. For each course, enter the corresponding mark when prompted.
4. The application will validate your inputs and display your course marks, average, and letter grade.

## Input Validation
- The application checks that the number of courses is a positive integer.
- Each course mark must be a number between 0 and 100. If an invalid mark is entered, the application will stop asking for further inputs and display an error message.

## Grading Scale
- **A+** : 90 and above
- **B**  : 80 to 89
- **C**  : 70 to 79
- **D**  : 60 to 69
- **F**  : Below 60

## Technologies Used
- HTML for the structure of the web page.
- JavaScript for the logic and interactivity.
